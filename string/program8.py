# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
x = "Hello"
print(x)

# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

# Get the character at position 4 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
z = "Hello, World!"
print(z[4])
print(z[0:6])
print(string.endswith("World!"))
